# Learning NLP with Python in 90 Minutes: 
## Colab, NLTK, and spaCy

*Stephen Skalicky*

**Abstract**

This hands-on workshop introduces participants to natural language processing using the Python programming language. Participants will learn how to create and use Google Colab notebooks in a web browser to begin coding with Python. Participants will then explore how the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) and spaCy Python libraries can analyse text data for various lexical properties (e.g., tokenizing, part of speech tagging). To ensure the best
experience, participants should have a Google drive account (drive.google.com) and bring their own laptop. No prior knowledge of programming is assumed.

**Instructions**

1. These materials use Google Colaboratory notebooks, which means you will need a Google account to use them. 
2. Once you have a Google account you are happy to use, look through the `colab-tutorials` folder to understand how the notebooks work. 
3. This repository contains several notebooks to work through, listed above
    - Notebook 1
    - Notebook 2
    - Notebook 3
4. To open a notebook, click the Open in Colab button which appears at the top of each notebook <img src = "https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg">
5. After the notebook opens in your browser, save the notebook to your Google Drive using the "Copy to Drive" button (or the drop-down menus)
6. You can now make new cells, add notes & code, and anything else you like! The original version of the notebook will always remain on the GitHub in case you need it.
