        "# Improving Lexical Diversity\n",
        "\n",
        "Lexical Diversity based on TTR is a very crude measure of vocabulary diversity. The above examples have used very short texts, and the resulting TTR values are somewhat meaningful. However, TTR has been heavily criticized for being a relatively poor measure of lexical diversity. Why is that? At least for English, one reason is that the overall length of a text will directly influence TTR. Longer texts will naturally start to repeat certain words again, such as function words like `the`, `a`, and `an`.\n",
        "\n",
        "To account for this problem, there are a surprisingly large number of different TTR metrics that have been developed. Many of them try to include some sort of average TTR by moving over and calculating TTR for portions of the text, or using some other sort of function which helps address the effects of text length. Some other research also points out that human measures of lexical diversity are not being captured in measures such as TTR.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "So, know that other measures exist. To wrap this notebook up, let's try to \"prove\" how text length might influence TTR while also getting some practice with function writing :)\n",
        "\n",
        "We are going to write a function which splits a text into segments and then calculates the TTR for each segment, and then averages those TTR values to get an average TTR.\n",
        "\n",
        "But first, let's consider how we might split a text into sentences. You might have noticed me using the `\\n` character in some of the print statements, this character represents a `newline` such as when you press the enter/return key to start a new paragraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that `.split()` will let you split a string on any character, this includes newlines! Consider the text below, it is all encoded as a single string, but because I copied and pasted it from a website in this format, it was retained new lines (I also use triple quotes \"\"\" to allow the string to span across these newlines). Run the cells to see how splitting on newlines can give us sentences:"
